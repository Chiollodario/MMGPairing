List device seriales:
adb devices

Access the device internal storage (general):
adb -s <device_serial> shell

In my case, with my devices, it is:
 - Smartphone
	adb -s 00f50299c4c120d8 shell
	
 - Smartwatch
	adb -s QEV7N17425002358 shell
	
Access the proper smartphone folder:
cd /storage/emulated/0/shared/Drawing_Data

Access the proper smartwatch folder:
cd /storage/emulated/0/shared/Accelerometer_Data

Transfer data from the device (exit from adb, going to a normal PowerShell):
adb pull /storage/emulated/0/shared/ C:\Users\DARIO-DELL\Desktop\
