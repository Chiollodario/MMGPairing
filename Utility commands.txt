List device seriales:
adb devices

Access the device internal storage (general):
adb -s <device_serial> shell



In my case, with my devices, it is:
 - Smartphone
adb -s 00f50299c4c120d8 shell
	
 - Smartwatch
adb -s QEV7N17425002358 shell
	
Access the proper smartphone folder:
cd /storage/emulated/0/shared/Drawing_Data

Access the proper smartwatch folder:
cd /storage/emulated/0/shared/Accelerometer_Data



Transfer folders from the devices (exit from adb, go to a normal PowerShell prompt):
 - From Smartphone
adb -s 00f50299c4c120d8 pull /storage/emulated/0/shared/ C:\Users\DARIO-DELL\Desktop\
	
 - From Smartwatch
adb -s QEV7N17425002358 pull /storage/emulated/0/shared/ C:\Users\DARIO-DELL\Desktop\
	
	

Transfer data from the devices to the same folder on the laptop (exit from adb, go to a normal PowerShell prompt):
 - From Smartphone
adb -s 00f50299c4c120d8 pull /storage/emulated/0/shared/Drawing_Data/ C:\Users\DARIO-DELL\Desktop\Collected_Data
	
 - From Smartwatch
adb -s QEV7N17425002358 pull /storage/emulated/0/shared/Accelerometer_Data/ C:\Users\DARIO-DELL\Desktop\Collected_Data
