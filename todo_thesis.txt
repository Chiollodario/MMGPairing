=========== 1st meeting ===================
DONE => interpolation   = 10Hz - 20 Hz (max 40 Hz) no more than 800 samples 
	Collect data at the highest rate possible. Post procesing with Python in order to get rid of the gravity, and so on
	(subtract the mean of each axis)
	
DONE => CSV = write the file the standard way (just Google it)

Plot screen x, y acceleration together with x, y, z acceleration, look for patterns (stuff happens at the same points in time)
5 lines per plot (2 for phone, for relative position, velocity, acceleration)

Sample the bump on both device (for starting the sample) and see the acceleration values

=========== 2nd meeting ===================
DONE => Interpolate and plot accoring to what we discussed during the first meeting (subtract the mean of each axis) --- LOOK AT THE PAPERS
